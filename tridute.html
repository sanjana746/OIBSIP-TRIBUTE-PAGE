      <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
      <p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, a coastal town in present-day Gujarat, India. Raised in a Hindu merchant caste family, Gandhi was deeply influenced by the religious and moral teachings of his mother and Jainism. At 19, he traveled to London to study law at University College London.</p>

      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>Gandhi became a lawyer and initially struggled professionally in India. He then went to South Africa in 1893, where he faced racial discrimination firsthand. This experience sparked his activism, leading him to develop the philosophy of Satyagraha, or nonviolent resistance, to fight injustice.</p>

      <h2>Philosophy and Impact</h2>
      <p>Gandhi's philosophy was centered on nonviolence (ahimsa), truth (satya), and civil disobedience. His approach emphasized peaceful protests and noncooperation to bring about political and social change. This inspired movements for civil rights and freedom worldwide, including leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela.</p>
